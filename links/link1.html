    <p> "Hakuna matata" (pronounced [hɑˈkunɑ mɑˈtɑtɑ]) is a Swahili language phrase from East Africa, meaning "no trouble" or "no problems". (The word "hakuna" means "there is no/there are no", while "matata" means "troubles" or "problems".[citation needed]) The phrase was used in Disney animated film The Lion King (which features a song named after the phrase), in which it is translated as "no worries". The song is often heard at resorts, hotels, and other places appealing to the tourist trade.[clarification needed]

    In 2018, Disney's trademark of the phrase in the US[1] caused controversy in East Africa.[2]</p>

    <p>In 1982, the music of Kenyan hostel band Them Mushrooms (now known as Uyoga) released the Swahili song "Jambo Bwana"[3] ("Hello Mister"), which repeats the phrase "Hakuna matata" in its refrain. The song was written by band leader John Katana.</p>

    <p>In 1983, German group Boney M. released "Jambo—Hakuna Matata", an English-language version of Them Mushrooms song Jambo Bwana. Liz Mitchell provided the song's lead vocals, backed by Reggie Tsiboe, Frank Farian, Cathy Bartney, Madeleine Davis and Judy Cheeks. The single was intended to be included in the group's untitled seventh album, to be released in the fall of 1983. Due to a poor chart performance (No. 48 in the German charts), the single ultimately was not included in the album (which was completely reworked and not released until May 1984 as Ten Thousand Lightyears).</p>
